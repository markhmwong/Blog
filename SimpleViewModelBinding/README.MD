# #2 Simple Model-View-ViewModel Binding
##### Tuesday 16th June 2020

Shamelessly taken from [Toptal's MVVM blog by Dino Bartosak](https://www.toptal.com/ios/swift-tutorial-introduction-to-mvvm), sharing as much as possible to anyone else that reads this would be a good idea, as it uses a simple class without Observers to react to changes made. Great for the UI.
