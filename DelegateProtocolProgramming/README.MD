# Delegate Protocol Programming (Swift)
##### Sunday 14th June 2020

### Intro
I used programming paradigm within my app Warmup which is my rewrite of EveryTime minus the parallel timer mode. While approaching the problem by using separation of concerns to modularise the Timer class and its' respective functions what would be relationship between the Timer to the ViewController and View and Model. Personally I don't like the approach I see on the web today where the topic is introduced but it basically uses a snippet. No hate, as it's great tool as a reminder.

So today, this blog will show a Stopwatch using the approach with a similar styling like Apple's UITableViewDelegate methods, again I used something very similar within Warmup so you can go see how it works on the App Store and check out the code here.
