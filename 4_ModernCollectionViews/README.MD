# #4 Modern Collection View - Simple Collection View List WWDC 2020

A simple implementation of the new Collection View List layout. This marks the beginning of the end for UITableView and a move towards using the new Collection View List.

Following from the WWDC project, it's quite easy to prepare with little changes to the way you would usually implement a collection view.

There is also the new .CellRegistration available as the main driver to create the cell layout with the usual .register method to register cells now absent.
